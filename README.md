# Solar-SSSI
### Jupyter notebook for mapping planning applications of solar farms in nature reserves (SSSIs)

- Data source is planning applications from https://www.planit.org.uk/api/ 
- Considers filters for solar farm planning applications in dataframe.
- Looks at limitations in data of spatial geometries.
- Takes SSSI shapefile from https://environment.data.gov.uk/DefraDataDownload/?mapService=NE/SitesOfSpecialScientificInterestEngland&Mode=spatial
- Maps planning applications within SSSIs in leafmap.

TODO: refine API filters, consider postGIS datasource
